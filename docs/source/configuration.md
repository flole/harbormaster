Configuring Harbormaster
========================

Harbormaster uses a single YAML configuration file to manage the deployment of
Compose apps. Below is an example of a typical configuration file:

```yaml
config:
  prune: true
apps:
  myapp:
    url: https://github.com/someuser/somerepo.git
    branch: main
    clean_start: false
    environment:
      FOO: bar
      MYVAR: 1
    environment_file: "somefile.txt"
  otherapp:
    url: https://gitlab.com/otheruser/otherrepo.git
    compose_config:
      - docker-compose.yml
      - docker-compose.harbormaster.yml
    environment_file: "somefile.yml"
  oldapp:
    enabled: false
    url: https://gitlab.com/otheruser/otherrepo.git
```

## Configuration directives

- `config`: Top-level configuration options.
  - `prune`: If set to `true`, it prunes all unused system images after a run to save
    space on the host. Be careful, as it will delete unused Docker images on your
    system.
- `apps`: A list of applications to deploy.
  - `myapp`: The name of the application. It can be anything you want.
    - `url`: The git repository URL to clone.
    - `branch`: The branch to deploy.
    - `clean_start`: If set to `false`, the app will not be shutdown prior to applying changes. 
    - `environment`: The environment variables to run Compose with.
    - `environment_file`: A file to load environment variables from. The file must
      consist of lines in the form of key=value. The filename is relative to the
      Harbormaster config file (this file). The file can also be a YAML file with the
      .yml extension, containing a single YAML collection of string values. Variables in
      the `environment` key take precedence over variables in the file.
  - `otherapp`: Another application to deploy.
    - `compose_config`: The Compose config filename, if it's not `docker-compose.yml`,
      or if you want to use Harbormaster-specific overrides.
    - `environment_file`: A YAML environment file.
  - `oldapp`: An old application that shouldn't be run.
    - `enabled`: If set to `false`, the app will not be run.
    - `url`: The git repository URL to clone. Two apps can use the same repo, in case
      you want to have multiple apps in the same repo (with different Compose filenames,
      or on different branches).

To execute Harbormaster, run `harbormaster run` in the same directory as the
configuration file. Harbormaster will parse the file, automatically download the
repositories mentioned in it and keep them up to date.

**Note:** Ensure that the Compose config in each of the repos does not use the
`container_name` directive, otherwise Harbormaster might not always be able to find your
apps and restart them when necessary.
